# TechBot

This is an ircbot I will be working on. It support loading modules/plugins. 

It is written in Python 3.4.3 and is being tested on Arch Linux.

There is no official documentation on it yet, but code comments and doc-strings should tell you anything
you need to know.

I am having issues with getting SSL to work, but will be trying to figure it out. In the mean time
to get started, make sure your config file has correct entries and your ready to go.
