# TechBot

This is an ircbot I will be working on. It support loading modules/plugins. 

It is written in Python 3.4.3 and is being tested on Arch Linux.

There is no official documentation on it yet, but code comments and doc-strings should tell you anything
you need to know.

SSL has been fixed, using Queues and Selector now. Examples have been updated in the adons.
